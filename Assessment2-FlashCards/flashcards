"Without feather or wing I fly, but you'll know what I am when I hover near by",Helicopter
Light as a feather but no man can hold me long,Breath
I'm heavy forward backward I'm not,Ton
"I have fingers,thumb but no hand",A glove
When I type I tap these on the keys.,Fingertips
A locked sphere without hinges or key. Break me open and golden treasures you'll see,Egg
What hatches without food?,Hunger
What speeds on a track but isn't in a race?,Train
If you lose me you may cause people around me to lose me too.,Temper
I stink up your breath and fights evil vampires.,Garlic
